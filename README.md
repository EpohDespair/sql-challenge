#PostGres database to hold old employee data
#Jupyter Notebook analysis of the fake employee data

Notes:
    In order to run the jupyter notebook, the creation of the database first is needed. Feed in the username(default user in pgadmin4 is postgres) and then the password set for postgres into the connection. Don't use any spaces, brackets, quotes.
